      <p>Hi there, this is Sanjiv Thapa currently living in New York, USA. We know the effort and dedication a student puts into pursuing a career abroad physically, financially, and mentally. Trying to pursue an academic /professional career abroad, keeping yourself away from home, family, and friends for a better future, and putting your hard work upfront to get an academic degree/achievement is not just a bit scary if you make the wrong choice.  Your first choice makes the difference, so be wise. We have been through that journey so we know explicitly how and what it takes to pursue a career abroad.  You are half done when you have the right information on hand and for that Aero Global is here on your service, for your ease, for that big leap towards the future.</p>
